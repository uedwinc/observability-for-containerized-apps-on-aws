# Implementing observability for a distributed application running on Amazon ECS

We will see four procedures to collect metrics and logs from ECS clusters:

1. Collect cluster and service-level metrics.
2. Collect instance-level metrics using the CloudWatch agent.
3. Collect instance-level metrics using ADOT.
4. Collect logs and send them to CloudWatch Logs using FireLens.

## Container Insights on Amazon ECS for the cluster- and service-level metrics

You can activate Container Insights on Amazon ECS for the cluster- and service-level metrics on the account and cluster levels.

When you activate Container Insights on an account level, every new Amazon ECS cluster created after that will have Container Insights data collection activated by default.

### Activate Container Insights on the account level

You can activate Container Insights on the account level using the AWS Management Console UI or the CLI.

1. To activate it using the AWS Management Console, go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/. In the menu on the left of the page, select `Account Settings`, click on the `Update` button in the top-right corner, and then at the bottom of the page, click on the checkbox under `CloudWatch Container Insights`, and then click on `Save changes`.

2. To activate Container Insights on the account level using the CLI, execute the following command:

```sh
aws ecs put-account-setting --name "containerInsights" --value "enabled"
```

### Activate Container Insights per cluster

Now, you can activate Container Insights per cluster if you want to save some costs on non-critical/low-margin environments or non-production environments. For new ECS clusters, you can also do it using the AWS Console Management UI or the CLI.

1. To create a new ECS cluster using the AWS Management Console with Container Insights enabled, you can follow the usual procedure to create a new cluster at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/, making sure you click on the `Enable Container Insights` checkbox under `Monitoring`.

2. If you are creating a new cluster using the CLI, you can do it with Container Insights enabled using the following command:

```sh
aws ecs create-cluster --cluster-name myCICluster --settings "name=containerInsights,value=enabled"
```

3. Activating Container Insights on an existing cluster is also easy. Assuming you have a variable named `clustername` with the cluster name, you need to execute the following command:

```sh
aws ecs update-cluster-settings --cluster ${clustername} --settings name=containerInsights,value=enabled --region ${AWS_REGION}
```

## Container Insights on Amazon ECS for instance-level metrics using ADOT

As an alternative to the CloudWatch agent, you can use `ADOT (AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry)` to collect instance- and application- level metrics.

1. Write [a script](../enable_container_insights_ecs_adot.sh) that will deploy an Amazon ECS service comprising the AWS ADOT collector and two sample applications. It will set up all required permissions.

2. Execute the script:

```sh
bash enable_container_insights_ecs_adot.sh
```

Once done, you can check to see the deployed workload accessing the Amazon ECS console

You can then check the Amazon Cloudwatch Container Insights details for the Amazon ECS `container-observability-ecs-cluster` task

## Collect logs and send them to CloudWatch Logs using FireLens

You can use **FireLens** to route logs to CloudWatch Logs for storage. 

1. Write a script to deploy an Amazon ECS task for this. The script will deploy an Amazon ECS service that uses FireLens to forward the applications log to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

2. Execute the script

After the execution of the script, you will find a new task accessing the Amazon ECS console and the `container-observability-ecs-cluster` cluster

You can visit the Amazon CloudWatch logs console. Thereâ€™s a new log group created by the FireLens agent, named `firelens-blog`. You can click to see the log events.
